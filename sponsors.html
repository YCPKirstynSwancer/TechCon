  <h3>Deloitte</h3>
  <p>We believe that we're only as good as the good we do.<br>
All the facts and figures that talk to our size and diversity and years of history, as notable and important as they may be, are secondary to the truest measure of Deloitte: The impact we make in the world.<br>
So, when people ask, ìWhatís different about Deloitte?î the answer resides in the many specific examples of where we have helped Deloitte member firm clients, our people, and sections of society to achieve remarkable goals, solve complex problems, or make meaningful progress. Deeper still, itís in the beliefs, behaviors, and fundamental sense of purpose that underpin all that we do.<br>
With more than 150 years of hard work and commitment to making a real difference, our organization has grown in scale and diversityóapproximately 245,000 people in 150 countries and territories, providing audit & assurance, tax, legal, risk and financial advisory and consulting servicesóyet our shared culture remains the same.<br>
For us, good isn't good enough. We aim to be the best at all that we doóto help clients realize their ambitions, to make a positive difference in society, and to maximize the success of our people. This drive fuels the commitment and humanity that run deep through our every action.<br>
Thatís what makes us truly different at Deloitte. Not how big we are, where we are, nor what services we offer. What really defines us is our drive to make an impact that matters in the world.<br>

  <h3>Fresh Roasted Hosting</h3>
  <p>
Fresh Roasted Hosting is an independent web hosting company headquartered in vibrant Casablanca City of Morocco. Tucked in among coffee houses, independent retailers, and the oldest continually-operating market house in Morocco, we deliver all the same high-end web hosting solutions youíd expect from our larger competitors, but with much better service ó and often at a better price!<br>
We believe that web hosting is a lot of serving coffee. Anyone can buy some supermarket-brand coffee grounds, plug in an automatic coffee maker, and start selling cheap coffee in styrofoam cups. It may not taste very good, but technically speaking, itís ìcoffeeî. But chances are, youíd much rather spend a few cents more and go to your favorite neighborhood coffee house. Thanks to their superior ingredients and better equipment, you get a fresh, hot, perfectly-made cup of coffee that tastes as good as it smells.<br></p>
